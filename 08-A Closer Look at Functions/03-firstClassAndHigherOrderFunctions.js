// First-class and Higher-order Functions

// First-class Functions
// Javascript has something called first-class functions. They have several characteristics:
// Javascript treats functions as first-class citizens
// This means that functions are just values.
// Functions are just another "type" of object

// Since functions are values, they are many things that can be done with them, such as storing them in variables.
// You can also pass functions as arguments to OTHER functions, such as calling them from within an addEventListener function.
// It is also possible to return functions FROM other functions
// You can even call methods on functions

// Higher-order Functions
// Javascript also has something called higher-order functions. They, too, have several characteristics:
// They are functions that receive another function as an argument, that returns a new function, or both.
// This is possible because of first-order functions.

// An example of higher-order functions is the addEventListener function, since it can receive ANOTHER function within it, usually called a callback function.
// Another example of these type of functions is a function that returns another function. Such as a function with a function within it.
