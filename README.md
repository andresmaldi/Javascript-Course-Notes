# Javascript-Course-Notes
These are my notes for a Javascript Course from the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.

You'll find detailes notes for each topic seen throughout the course, written in .js form with examples of each unique topic. 
Every folder comes with a "testingscripts.html" file where you can choose a different file in order to check its contents in the Google Chrome console. (CMD + ALT + J to open on Mac).

I've written down these notes in order to help me learn everything more easily, I hope they can be useful for others too.
