<!-- Basic Styling with CSS -->

<!-- CSS -->
<!-- CSS means Cascading Style Sheet 
    It is the programming language that styles an html document, changing how it looks -->

<!-- Styling inside an html document -->
<!-- It is possible to style an html document from within html directly.
    This, however, is not common practice. -->

<!-- The Style Attribute-->
<!-- To use CSS inside an html document, we use the style element and write our CSS in it 
    Example: -->

<body style="background-color: red;">

</body>

<!-- The Syle element -->
<!-- It is also possible to style with the style element, placed in the head element 
    Example: -->

<head>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: green;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<!-- Separate CSS File -->
<!-- The most common practice is to do the styling of CSS in a separate document.
    This document can then be linked to the html document using a link element and an href attribute.
    For CSS files, the rel attribute must be set to stylesheet.
    Example: -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="03-basicStylingWithCss.css">
