<!-- Basic HTML and CSS Crash Course
    HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language 
    It is used to describe the content of web pages-->

<!-- Elements and Tags -->
<!-- HTML uses elements
    These elements must be enclosed in tags 
    Example: -->

<body> </body>

<!-- Head and Body Elements -->
<!-- An HTML document is composed of a head and a body 
    The head is used for things like the title as well as linking some files
    The body is where everything we want to be visible in a web page should be placed -->

<head>

</head>

<body>

</body>

<!-- Heading Element -->
<!-- We have different types of headings as well 
    This are represented with an <h> element
    They descend from the biggest (h1) to the smallest (h6)
    Example: -->

<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h6></h6>

<!-- Paragraph Element -->
<!-- To write information we use a paragraph element <p> 
    In here, we can write whatever we want as long as it's text
    Example: -->

<p> Example text </p>
