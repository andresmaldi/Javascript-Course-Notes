// Types of Operators

// Arithmetic operators
// We can use addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, etc

// Subtraction

const ageAndres = 2022 - 1994;/* This would give us 28 */

// Addition

const fingersAndresRight = 5;
const fingersAndresLeft = 5;
const fingersAndres = fingersAndresLeft + fingersAndresRight; /* This would give us 10 */

// Multiplication

const populationBogota = 8 * 1000000; /* This would give us 8 million */

// Division 

const familyMembersPerHouse = 4 / 2; /* This would give 2 */

// Exponentiation

const childrenToHave = 2 ** 3; /* This would give us 8 (2x2x2) */

// Concatenation
// This is used to join two or more strings, not numbers

const firstName = "Andres";
const middleName = "Felipe";
const fullName = firstName + middleName; /* This would concatenate the two strings and give us "AndresFelipe" */

// The = operator

let x = 10 + 5; /* This is equal to 15 */
x += 10; /* This is equal to x = x + 10 which is 25 */
x *= 4; /* This is equal to x = x * 4 which is 100 */
x++; /* This is equal to x + 1 */
x--; /* this is equal to x - 1 */

// Comparison operators
// Less than and Greater Than operators
let ageAna = 33;
let ageJuliana = 34;

ageAna < ageJuliana; /* This would be true */
ageAna > ageJuliana; /* This would be false */

// Less than or equal and Greater than or equal operators
let ageVictoria = 18;

ageVictoria >= 18; /* this would be true */
ageVictoria <= 17; /* This would be false */
