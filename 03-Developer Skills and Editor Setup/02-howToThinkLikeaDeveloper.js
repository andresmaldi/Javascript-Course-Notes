2.  Take a very logical and rational approach (programming is just logic, after all).

3.  Use a 4-step framework to solve any problem.

    How to Solve Problems Like a Developer

1.  Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem.

2.  Divide and Conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems.

3.  Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to.

4.  For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code.
