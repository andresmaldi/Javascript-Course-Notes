/*  How to Succeed at Learning How to Code

1.  Set a specific, measurable, realistic, and time-based goal.
        Know exactly why you are learning to code.

2.  Don't just copy code.
        Understand everything you are doing and why.

3.  Reinforce your learning.
        After you learn a new concept, use it immediately.
        Take notes.
        Challenge yourself with small exercises and challenges.

4.  Practice coding outside of courses.
        Practicing is the most important part of learning a new skill.
        Come up with project ideas, popular sites or applications or even just parts of them at the beginning.
5.  Don't get frustrated.
        Don't get stuck trying to write perfect code.
        Write a lot of code, no matter the quality.
6.  Understand you will never know everything.
        You will probably never know everything, accept this fact and embrace it.
        Focus on what you need at the moment to achieve your goal.
    
7.  Don't learn in isolation.
        Try to learn with someone, this will help in the learning process.
        Try to explain what you learned, to check if you truly understood everything.
        Share your goals to make yourself accountable.
        Share your learning process with the web dev community.
    
8.  Don't think that just by taking course you'll be a web developer.
        Courses are a great beginning and offer a wonderful foundation, but real life experience requires a lot of practice.
